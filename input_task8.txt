Two different things with one mouth, girls call you ‘unnie’
“Two different things with one mouth” is something that has been traditionally tabooed for men in Korea. 
There are even old sayings such as 남아일언중천금 (男兒一言重千金;
a real guy’s one word carries the weight of a thousand pieces of gold). 
It is obviously an outcome of gender-biased prejudice, but is still widely used. 
Some would jokingly call a man who changes his word “a woman.” 
With that said, “girls call you unnie” because “you” said two different things from one mouth. 
“Since you spoke two different things with one mouth, you’re not a real man. 
So, I’m going to treat you as a woman, and those girls will call you unnie.”
